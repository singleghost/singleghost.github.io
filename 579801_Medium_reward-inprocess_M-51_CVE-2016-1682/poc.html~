<h1>Serviceworker CSP issues</h1>

<p>Hey, the following test cases are all the same apart from the meta tag served with the CSP policy. This experience appears to be exactly the same with HTTP headers also.

When loading these URLS in FF latest the correct experience is observed</p>

<ul>
        <!-- <li><a href="iframe.html">Legacy frame-src - expected errors</a> -->
<li><a href="other.html">set default-src to none and not set worker-src or child-src. - expected errors</a>
<li><a href="set.html">Set child-src incorrectly to another origin - expected errors</a>
<li><a href="set-worker-src.html">Set worker-src incorrectly to another origin - expected no errors</a>
<li><a href="success.html">Correct set worker-src - expected no errors</a>
</ul>
